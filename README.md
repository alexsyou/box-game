# BoxGame
BoxGame is a game about leaping off of walls as a box.

#About
In BoxGame, you are a box. Your origins are unknown but you now jump off of walls.
These walls will move for a certain distance before getting homesick and returning.
However, in a turn of fate, you have been cursed to only move walls.
